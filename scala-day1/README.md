Old Code Warning!!
==================

I wrote the day1 code a while back, it's my first foray into Scala after 35 years of imperative programming without really realising I was supposed to be using an FP paradigm. I'd also skipped straight here from chapter one of the book without realising they were deliberately ordered - this all makes so much more sense after doing the Prolog stuff.

I've also since done the Coursera "FP in Scala" course and a bit more functional programming, so don't judge me on this - but I'm honest enough to keep it lying around for interest.

I came back to this afterwards, so from scala-day2 onwards there's a 10 month gap's worth of additional experience in there.
